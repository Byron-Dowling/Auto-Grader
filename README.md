# Auto-Grader

## Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to create an OpenCV application that will run handwriting analysis on tests that are graded by one of my Computer Science professors. The tests have a cover page with a rubric where each test section is scored and points earned are written in the results column. The idea is that once the grading is complete, my professor will place the graded test under the webcam that is running the handwriting model and it will determine what scores are written and tally them up and log the results so that they can be entered into the gradebook once all the grading is done.

## System Platform

- PyTorch
- OpenCV

## Status
- In-Progress 3-30-2023
